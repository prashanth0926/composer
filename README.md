# composer
compose and run all your dependent apps at one place using one command

### setup

### compose and run apps
create a configuration file refering to [config.json](config.json) with your dependent apps and their settings <br/>run **`compose `*`config-file`*`.json`** <br/> or <br/> run **`compose`** <br/>
by default compose would look for **config.json** if the config file is not passed

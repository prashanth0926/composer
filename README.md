# composer
*feeling lazy to clone, install dependencies and run several applications one after the other, no worries harness the power of composer to do all that at one place by just a single command*

### setup
run **`npm i -g`**

### compose and run apps
create a configuration file refering to [config.json](config.json) with your dependent apps and their settings <br/>run **`compose `*`config-file`*`.json`** <br/> or <br/> run **`compose`** <br/>
by default compose would look for **config.json** if the config file is not passed
